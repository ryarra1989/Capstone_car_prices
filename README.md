Predicting Used Car Prices Using Machine Learning

Initial Report: Predicting Used Car Prices with Machine Learning

Introduction
This report explores the use of machine learning models to predict used car prices. Accurate price predictions can empower both buyers and sellers to make informed choices and help dealerships refine their pricing strategies.

Data Collection and Exploration
The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle, containing detailed information about used cars, such as make, model, year, mileage, and price.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is employed to understand data distribution, identify missing values, and detect outliers. The notebook includes relevant code and visualizations.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves addressing missing values, performing feature engineering, and normalizing the data.

Model Building and Evaluation
Several models will be developed and evaluated, including linear regression and LASSO. Cross-validation and grid search will be used for hyperparameter tuning. More complex models, like neural networks and decision trees, will be explored in the final capstone report.

Conclusion
This report demonstrates the application of machine learning models for predicting used car prices. Additional models will be explored in the capstone report.
